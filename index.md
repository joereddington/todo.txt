# Public Todo List 

My todo list is public. 

It's updated every hour or so when my machine is running. That script also updates a chart showing the size of the lists over time.  The different coloured lines show how long something has been in the list:

* Blue - current size 
* Green - 1 day old 
* Purple - 3 days old
* Red - 7 days old.
