# Public Todo List 

My todo list is public. It's split into two parts. My personal list, and my work list. 
It's updated every hour or so when my machine is running. That script also updates a chart showing the size of the lists over time.  

## Personal list


<IMG SRC="priority.png" alt="Chart showing the size of the personal list over time" width=400>

<pre>
{% include_relative todo.txt %} 
</pre>

## Work list 
<IMG SRC="eqt.priority.png" alt="Chart showing the size of the work list over time" width=400>


<pre>
{% include_relative eqt.todo.txt %} 
</pre>
