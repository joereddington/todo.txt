Doing the Code for Kat. 

Most of today is about restructuring, moving into classes and using the new input files. A lot of today was working out why some tests are slow and that got a lot to do with the speed of the python-docx library.  

One of the activities I ended up trying earlier was starting from scratch, it got my brain in gear and that was great, and it meant I learned some things about how to make tests better

Various issues on this: 

### Plan

* Update the demos. 
* Rename 'upload' to 'create' 
* Get the code working again and find out where it fails.
* Remove the Nationality of the voice. 

Our first issue was that the upload file wasn't being found.  I looked and the designs folder was empty. I scped everthing accross but that didn't help. It turned out that the domain was being served from the wrong account.  I opened a support ticked, got an email back and it appears to have been fixed this morning. 


Later Notes: installed the pptx library as a user, the following issue was that the .htaccess file that we'd used before hadn't come through.

Reviewing the information that Peter Buck requested. This included: 
* Working out if expenses should be included 
* Separating out Staff Pay from All expenses  
* Working out that some of our payments come from different 'accounts' and working out how to show them in a report. 

Main THING I found out is that I CAN'T currently replicate this in Quickbooks. There is a payroll system but it costs money and we never set it up. So it is for separate documents  

I spoke to Mum on the phone (with Nova) and confirmed a few bits at the same time. Overall I've decided that we should leave it as mum sent it.

So, this is what Alan Turing's Status looked like on his birthday! 

You did this, once again you came together and did this, and you raised £2,056.41 for Special Effect. 

## Accounting!
Okay, the accounting part:

* We were again approached by a private donor, who, at our advice, sent £1,000 to special effect. We remain staggered by this.
* The Paypal pool raised £1,056.41. 
* Bath University sent Joe personally £43.74 (they had those payment details from a previous year) 
* There were then two large purchases of flowers, one of 59.66 and one of 34.84, for a total of £94.50.  The receipts are below.
* This leaves exactly £530 to transfer to special effect. Screenshot below.

It's a headed paper letter, 

Dear Anthony, 

Following our recent meeting I'm have sent some details on our costs and the proportions that are provided as 'in kind' contributions. 

As you know, our licensing fee is £600, and as a longstanding gesture of goodwill we purchase copies of the published books for the writers and pay the delivery costs (amount varies by camp, but the most recent figure for a camp was £131.66) for 'Virtual Immortality'.  As part of the same gesture we also pay Richard Seymour's Expense claims which are normally in the £40-£60 region. 

For completeness, you are aware that we've offered to waive our licensing fee in some circumstances to help you scale up the process. This obviously would be considered a donation in our accounts and should be seen similarly. 

Yours, 

Dr Joseph Reddington
